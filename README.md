### From Research to Data Analysis: My GitHub Page 👨‍💻

I am a research scientist with a passion for finding innovative and cost-effective solutions to challenging problems through experimental designs and methodologies. While at job, I developed interest in using data analysis and visualization to develop and test hypotheses, which led me to pursue a new career path in data science and analytics, and I am now ready to take on roles as a data analyst/data scientist. I am actively seeking opportunities in industries such as earth sciences, petroleum, climate, renewable energy, and sustainability sector, where I can use my expertise and apply my skills to tackle real-world challenges.

My GitHub page serves as a platform to showcase my skills and experience in data science and analytics. Although I have taken courses in machine learning a while back to incorporate it into my research work; at present:

- 🔭 I’m working on data analytics portfolio projects
- 🌱 I’m learning ETL and Power Query/DEX
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects on earth sciences, renewable energy & sustainability sector
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with career guidance and pathway to ML engineering & MLOps
- 💬 Ask me about my background in nanotechnology and its applications in the oil and gas industry
